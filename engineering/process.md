# Our engineering process
## Values
Our engineering process works well if it exhibits these traits:
* **Focused:** we are extremely resource constrained, therefore focusing on the top priority  items is extremely important. A balance between creative tinkering, refactoring & new feature work has to be found and constantly adjusted. 
* **Minimize process:** Process and structure should be kept at a mininum and applied only where it is truly beneficial and distracting from the task at hand at hand as little as possible. 
* **Empowered contributors:** Every contributor should feel ownership over the work they do
* **Accountability:** With ownership and empowerment should also come accountability.
* **Scalable:** We need to be agile and efficient at our current stage but we also need to make sure we can scale this process beyond 10 contributors and beyond the scope of the team at Centrifuge.
* **Open source friendly:** We want our development process to be accessible for external people and contributing should be possible and encouraged
* **Emerging standards:** Instead of overthinking our process we should strive for adding and evolving practices as we see need for them, try things out and iterate on it.

## Specific Needs
* Roadmap: we want to have a roadmap that we can communicate to our stakeholders
* Our process should allow for rebalancing capacity when an effort needs more attention
* We want a small core team at Centrifuge Inc. but in the foreseeable future other teams will take over other parts of the development. 
* Our architecture needs to support the values we set ourselves for the engineering team (accountability, empowerment, focused,...).
* The protocol should be developed independently of the rest of the application. We should move towards specifying the rules that define our protocol outside of the general codebase.
* Everyone should drive and own certain issues.
* 100% awareness for the entire team doesn't scale well enough and we are already too big for doing all meetings together.

## Our Tribe, Individual Circles, and Leaders
The Tribe is the overall organizational unit. It's our family at Centrifuge the company as a whole. As a team, we plan vacation, grow our team, coach each other, and come together every once in a while. 

A circle is a loose and spontaneous unit that only comes into existence for a specific need. Circles have no fixed structure but are encouraged to work in whichever way works best. A Circle should always have a single leader assigned.

As soon as more than one person is involved in an issue, it becomes important to assign responsibility to someone to avoid no one feeling responsible at all. The leader's role is not to make decisions or have more say in the process but:

* Ensure there are no blockers and process is smooth. Raise issues if there are any.
* Be the first point of contact
* Facilitate the smooth development
* Report on roadmap progress

## From Sand to Pebbles to Rocks
At the highest level, we have to have an overview over everything that's going on, and of course the more information the better. But unfortunately our processing capacity as a tribe and individuals is limited and so oversharing brings the productivy of everyone to a halt. Completely getting rid of cross tribe communication doesn't work either though. We need to coordinate our efforts as a whole to plan our resources, set priority, navigate dependencies and communicate our roadmap to our users. It's important to keep our tribe in sync, make sure we are aware of what others are doing. At a macro level, we should share information broadly. Meetings with the entire tribe are useful for this. At the micro level, we should share with a smaller group of people. This comes quite naturally in any kind of organization but it's something that is easy to forget in the midst of day to day work. 

Circles involve stakeholders and/or the entire tribe to declare & coordinate dependencies, schedules and priorities. Those meetings don't need to be at the level of detail of fine grained sand, talking about pebbles or even rocks is enough. In practice this means, if there are decisions to make, prepare the available options, collect advantages and disadvantages and then use the meeting to discuss practical, actionable decisions instead of hypotheticals. Present enough information for everyone to follow. 

## Roadmap & Planning
### Proposal for Tribe & Circles
Meetings:
* **Tribe Gathering:** a long (2hrs - a full day) share the roadmap and discuss product vision, as needed, at least every 2 months. 
* **Tribe Retrospective:** monthly meeting to come together and reflect on our process and how we work together
* **Epic Review:** keep it short, use this meeting to update external people on the progress, the decisions that have been made or still need to be made and bring up any topics for discussions. Any stakeholders as well as other people that work on tangential topics should be invited to attend.
* **Shipped Meeting:** A meeting to share the stuff that has been shipped with the tribe. Show off what you've done. 
* **House Keeping:** biweekly. If neccessary, circles and management can meet in the off-weeks to prepare the unplanned tickets for the meeting.
* **Standup** (tribe-level for now): Daily standup to get a pulse on things, mention blockers and keep in sync.

Work inside of circles:
Feel free to structure the work as needed. Some efforts might require more structure while others less. If you want to create a slack channel for your circle, feel free to do so. If you'd rather do daily standups, you can do that.

Prioritization:
When planning an epic, a circle commits to a rough vision and scope for what should be implemented as well as a timeline for these deliverables. It's the circle's responsibility to make sure that every effort is made to focus on a force ranked list of features and escalate to the tribe if delivering the must haves in time is at risk. At a more fine grained level, circles are free to prioritize and plan within the scope of their projects as needed. 

## Running efficient meetings [WIP]
* Have an agenda
* Prepare for meetings, share materials beforehand if possible
* When deviating from the agenda, ask the question: does it make sense to discuss that now in this group? Or can this be a smaller group?
